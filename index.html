                                <br> during a marketing challenge</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Our team is made up of students
                                from the Gaming campus school. During a
                                challenge given by our school we have to bring
                                together students from the 2 gaming campus
                                schools, in order to assemble our skills and
                                knowledge for a two day marketing project.
                                The project consists in creating a mobile game
                                related to a game from our childhood. Our
                                mission is to do all the marketing and
                                communication aspects of this game.

                                To start this challenge we first had to find the
                                game. We were inspired by our childhood game
                                "Hen, Fox, Viper".
                                We all played this game when we were little so
                                we were inspired by this game.

                                Then we decided to change the game and make it
                                our own. So we changed the fox and viper hens to
                                elves, dwarves and orcs.</p>
